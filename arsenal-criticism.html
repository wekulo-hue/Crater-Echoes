    <h2 style="color:#9b2fae;">Why People Should Stop Criticizing Arsenal Over Set-Piece Goals</h2>

    <p>In modern football, every team finds its own way to win — and for Arsenal, set-pieces have become a powerful weapon. Yet, some critics have begun to mock or downplay Arsenal’s goals from corners and free-kicks, as if scoring through tactical discipline is somehow less impressive than open-play brilliance. That mindset needs to change.</p>

    <h3>⚽ Set Pieces Are Part of the Game</h3>
    <p>Scoring from a set piece is not luck — it’s planning, precision, and hard work. Arsenal’s coaching staff, led by Mikel Arteta, have invested countless hours in perfecting these routines. Every movement, every block, every delivery from players like Declan Rice or Martin Ødegaard is calculated. When these plays pay off, it’s a reflection of intelligent football, not a shortcut. If football is about using your strengths, then Arsenal are doing exactly what great teams do — playing smart.</p>

    <h3>🔵 What About Manchester City?</h3>
    <p>If we’re going to talk about “overreliance,” let’s look elsewhere too. Manchester City, as dominant as they are, often rely heavily on Erling Haaland’s goal-scoring machine. Without his finishing touch, City can look surprisingly flat in attack. Yet, no one calls that “uncreative” or “boring.” Instead, they praise Pep Guardiola’s system — as they should. So why not give Arsenal the same respect for maximizing their own strengths?</p>

    <h3>🔵 And Chelsea?</h3>
    <p>Chelsea, on the other hand, have faced a different kind of issue — discipline. Multiple red cards in key games have cost them momentum, points, and stability. That’s an area that truly deserves criticism because it affects the team’s ability to even compete. Arsenal’s efficiency from set-pieces, in contrast, is an advantage, not a flaw.</p>

    <h3>🟥 Double Standards in Football</h3>
    <p>Fans and pundits sometimes hold Arsenal to a strange double standard. When others win ugly, it’s called “grit.” When Arsenal score from a corner, it’s “boring.” But goals win games — and a corner goal counts the same as a 25-yard screamer. Every champion team in history has used all available tools to win, and that’s exactly what Arsenal are doing.</p>

    <h3>💪 The Bottom Line</h3>
    <p>Football has evolved. There’s no single “beautiful” way to score. Whether it’s a lightning-fast counterattack, a header from a corner, or a penalty — it’s all part of the game’s beauty. Arsenal’s set-piece mastery should be celebrated, not mocked.</p>

    <p>So before critics talk about “boring goals,” they should look at their own favorite clubs — and realize that success, in any form, is built on discipline, intelligence, and execution.</p>
